# what is Git:

## Snapshots:

Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots.

DVSC: Distributed Version Control systems.

-Local Operations:

Git mostly relies on local operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources.

-Tracking Changes:

Every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git. And, as the gatekeeper, Git will always detect file corruption or loss of information in transit.

-Loss of Data:

Git is set up to greatly minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files, such as accidentally lost data. Git makes it extremely difficult for a snapshot of your file that is committed to be lost.



### States

Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified, and staged.

### Committed:

Data is securely stored in a local database.

### Modified:

The file has been changed but not committed to the database.




##### Configuration of Variables

An inherent Git tool called git config allows the setting of configuration variables that control aspects of Git’s operation and look.
